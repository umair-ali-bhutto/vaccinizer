## Introduction

As the world grapples with the challenges posed by the Coronavirus pandemic, we have designed and developed a web application for an online test and vaccination booking system for patients. The Covid-19 web app serves as a bridge between people, hospitals, and administration, encouraging collaboration in the fight against the pandemic. This web app allows users to track vaccination appointments, access vaccination history, and follow Covid-19 solution guidelines for symptoms.

## Proposed Solution

The application provides an Online Registration System (ORS), linking various hospitals across the country for mobile number-based online registration and appointment scheduling. The portal facilitates online appointments for vaccinations. Detailed reports showing information about test and vaccination patients taking appointments through this portal can be seen. Hospitals can join this platform, provide their appointment slots for online booking by patients, and easily manage their registration and appointment process while monitoring the flow of patients.
